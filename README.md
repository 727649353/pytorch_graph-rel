# [ACL'19 (long)] GraphRel: Modeling Text as Relational Graphs for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction
A **PyTorch** implementation of GraphRel

[Project]() | [Paper]() | [Poster]()

## Overview

## Requirements
This code is implemented under **Python3** and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). <br>
Following libraries are also required:
+ [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) >= 0.4
+ [spaCy](https://spacy.io)

## Usage
We use [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) as **pre-trained word embedding** and **dependency parser**.

## Resources
+ NYT Dataset
+ WebNLG Dataset
